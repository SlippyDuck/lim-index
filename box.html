					<p class="one">Title Narrator: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

				Barry: Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Yeah! Let's shake it up a little.

				[gurgling]

				Barry! Breakfast is ready!

				Barry: Comin'! Hang on a second. Hello?
				Barry?
				Adam?
				Can you believe this is happening?
				I can't believe it. I'll pick you up.
				Lookin' sharp.

				Barry, why don't you use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
				Sorry. I'm excited.
				Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. And a perfect report card, all B's.
				Very proud.
				Ma! I got a thing going here.
				You got some lint on your fuzz.
				Ow! That's me!
				Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
				Bye!
				Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!

				- Hey, Adam.
				- Hey, Barry.
				- Is that fuzz gel?
				- A little. It's special day, finally graduating.
				Never thought I'd make it.
				Yeah, three days the grade school, three days the high school.
				Those were so awkward.
				Three days the college. I'm glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive.
				You did come back different.

				- Hi, Barry.
				- Hey, Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

				- Hey, did you hear about Frankie?
				- Yeah.
				- You going to his funeral?
				- No, I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone, you die. You don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead.
				Yeah, I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.

				I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day.
				I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.

				Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.</p>

				Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.

				This is it!
				Wow.
				Wow.
				We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
				Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
				Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
				[all] Honey!
				- That girl was hot.
				- She's my cousin!
				- She is?
				- Yes, we're all cousins.
				- Right. You're right.
				- At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
				These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.</p>
